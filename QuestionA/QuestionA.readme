# Test cases (the tests in my test file doesn't strictly follow this order)

# Simple cases overlap
# Simple cases not overlap
# Include float numbers
# Negative numbers
# Input line with end smaller than start
# Two lines have same start/end
# Include points (my assumption: points are also considered as overlap)
